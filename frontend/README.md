## üì¶ Introduction

This is a developer browser side project application built using **React** and **TypeScript**. Designed to provide ability to manage and browse developer CVs. The app offers a responsive and modular UI, making it easy to extend and integrate with various development tools and APIs.

## Notes

- Tests are now only configured with some exemplary added (to be changed in the future)
- State will need to be extended with new slices if the application grows
- This is a portfolio project. No plans of deploying it long term.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager
- A modern web browser (for testing and usage)
- A configured backend running (located in the `backend` folder within this repository)

Optionally, having a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended for development.
